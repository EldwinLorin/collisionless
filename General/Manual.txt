Usage:
Compile with a fortran compiler and the LAPACK library:

gfortran -o collisionless collisionless.f90 -llapack

run it with input file named 'collisionless.inp'
Example input file is mostly self-explanatory
Except the numbering of which species are connected by TSs is a bit strange.
The 1st products in the products list also has to be the reactants.
1=reactants
2- (nwells+1) = wells
(nwells+2) - end = products.

So an entrance TS linking the reactants to the 1st well is 1 2
The backdissociation to the reactants is 2 - (nwells+2)  (that is the same TS but it also has to be included the other way ...)
A TS connecting the 3rd well with the 2nd well (and the other way around) is 3 - 4



DOS files: first column : energy, J next colums: N(E,J) sum of states
DOS files were obtained with Variflex for loose TSs using VRCTST. For tight, densum was used for vibrational sum of states and subsequently convoluted for J.

Result files: kJ contains the contribution for each J value to each channel and to the overall rate constant
Results contain general T resolved results for each channel, all_k contains the same without text to be read by other scripts
