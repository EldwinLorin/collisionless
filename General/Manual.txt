Usage:
Compile with a fortran compiler and the LAPACK library:

gfortran -o collisionless collisionless.f90 -llapack

run it with input file named 'collisionless.inp'
Example input file is mostly self-explanatory
DOS files: first column : energy, J next colums: N(E,J) sum of states
DOS files were obtained with Variflex for loose TSs using VRCTST. For tight, densum was used for vibrational sum of states and subsequently convoluted for J.

Result files: kJ contains the contribution for each J value to each channel and to the overall rate constant
Results contain general T resolved results for each channel, all_k contains the same without text to be read by other scripts
